The R Script performs the following changes to the dataset:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. (by first combining the three txt files in train and three txt files in test, and then combining train and test)
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set (using the txt file activity_labels.txt)
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. (using the txt file features.txt)
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
